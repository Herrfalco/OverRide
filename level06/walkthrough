- we need to authenticate using a correct login and password
- password and login are checked in auth function
- this function encodes the login and check if the password is equal to this encoded
login

- we have to create a program that recreates the login transformation
- we can now enter a random password (at least 5 characters) into pass_cracker wich
will give us the coresponding password
	- pass_cracker bonjour -> 6233767
	- bonjour as login and 6233767 as password
	- cat /home/users/level07/.pass
