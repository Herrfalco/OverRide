- in set_username, buff is copied into msg->user but there's a mistake in the for loop,
41 characters are copied instead of 40
- msg->user is overflowed and we can set msg->len value to 255

- in set_msg we can now overflow msg->body and overwrite handle_msg return address
with the address of secret_backdoor

- so we need to write 40 (msg.user size) random bytes followed by the value 255 as
username and then 192 (msg full size) + 8 (saved rbp) = 200 bytes of random values
followed by the address of secret_backdoor as message and finally the command that
will be executed in system
	- secret_backdoor @ 0x000055555555488c

- we can write our exploit command filling remaining fgets buffers with random values
	- ruby -e 'print "x" * 40 + "\xff" + "x" * (86 + 192 + 8) +
	"\x8c\x48\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00" + "\x00" * 815 + "cat /home/users/end/.pass"'
