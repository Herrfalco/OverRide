- the program takes a file path as argument
- it makes a backup of this file in ./backups/
- if we put .pass as argument we can then read the flag in ./backups/.pass

- we need to do it with level09 .pass file @ /home/users/level09/.pass but
we are stuck because we don't have permission to create directories inside
./backups/

- but we can do it inside /tmp
	- mkdir -p /tmp/backups/home/users/level09/
- and then call the program from inside tmp with level09 .pass as argument
	- cd /tmp; /home/users/level08/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
- finally we can print our backed up flag
	- cat /tmp/backups/home/users/level09/.pass
